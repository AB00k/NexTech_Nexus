## Usage

Activate the Voice-powered Assistant by: 
- **pressing RECORD 3 times** (regretfully our team was filled with streamlit n00bs)
- Now give your voice command
- After you're done with your command press **STOP 1 time** ! 
- Now you will see "Running" on the top left corner (this means the bot is transcribing your voice command to text. Be patient!)
- When the agent is done it will output your voice command (in sound and written language)
- By **pressing STOP 2 more times** you'll be back where you started

A few examples:
- **Press RECORD 3 times** -> "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 3 PM." ->  **Press STOP 1 time** -> Wait -> After answer **press STOP 2 more times** (and go again :))
- **Press RECORD 3 times** "Compose an email to [recipient@email.com] with the subject 'Project Update'." ->  **Press STOP 1 time** -> Wait -> After answer **press STOP 2 more times** (and go again :))
- **Press RECORD 3 times** "Show me unread emails from last week." ->  **Press STOP 1 time** -> Wait -> After answer **press STOP 2 more times** (and go again :))

## Note on FFmpeg

> ‚ùó If you encounter any issues related to sound output, it's likely due to FFmpeg. 

To resolve this:
1. Visit [FFmpeg's official website](https://ffmpeg.org/).
2. Download the source code.
3. Remember to add FFmpeg to your system's PATH after installation.
